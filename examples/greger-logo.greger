# SYSTEM

I have my REPLICATE_API_TOKEN available to shell commands. I have already installed the Replicate Python SDK.

Before you start writing files, initialize a new Git repository.

Download and read these docs:
* https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python.md
* https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro/llms.txt
* https://replicate.com/851-labs/background-remover/llms.txt

I got the name "Greger" from Greger Tragg in Legat till en trol√∂s by Kjell-Olof Bornemark. Search for inspiration about Greger Tragg.

Note that when running 851-labs/background-remover you need to pass the version `851-labs/background-remover:a029dff38972b5fda4ec5d75d7d1cd25aeff621d2cf4946a41055d7db66b80bc`.

Use the `python` command to run Python code, not `python3` or similar.

# USER

Make a Python script in ./greger-logo that generates a logo for ~/projects/greger.el.

The theme for the logo should be an agent (in the Greger Tragg sense).

The logo should be stylized and logo-like, but colorful and playful. Make 20 different ones so I have options.

10 of the logo candidates should have 'greger.el' written on them, and half should not have text.

Use black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro to generate the image and 851-labs/background-remover to remove the background.

Run all 20 generations in parallel.

Once you've written the script, run it (and fix it if it doesn't work). Once you've generated 20 images, open the output folder so I can browse them.
