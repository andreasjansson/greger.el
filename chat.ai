## USER:

I've made a small start at adding support for citations in greger-parser.el. Finish the implementation.

Citations are used in web search tool results, documented here: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool.md

Note that the citations are folded up with the assistant message.

I want the following formatting:

``` markdown
## USER:

When was Claude Shannon born?

## SERVER TOOL USE:

Name: web_search
ID: srvtoolu_01WYG3ziw53XMcoyKL4XcZmE

### query

## ASSISTANT:

Based on the search results, <cite>Claude Shannon was born on April 30, 1916, in Petoskey, Michigan</cite>

## CITATIONS:

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon

Title: Claude Shannon - Wikipedia
Cited text: Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 â€“ February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, computer scientist, cryptographer and i...
Encrypted index: Eo8BCioIAhgBIiQyYjQ0OWJmZi1lNm..
```

followed by potentially other citations in the form

```
### URL

Title: title
Encrypted index: encrypted_index
Cited text: cited_text
```

Note that:
* `type` is always `web_search_result_location`
* The URL is in the heading
* I want it ordered like it is in my example, with title first and encrypted index last
* The text in the list item with the citations object is wrapped in `<cite>`, but otherwise folded into the previous ASSISTANT: section.

Implement this in greger-parser.el and add tests to test-greger-parser.el

Add tests for the exact format in the anthropic docs linked above, but also variations, e.g. if the list item with citations isn't preceded by a type:text item but immediately follows the web_search_tool_result.


## ASSISTANT:

I'll help you finish the implementation of citations support in greger-parser.el. First, let me examine the current code to understand what's already implemented.

# Web search tool

The web search tool gives Claude direct access to real-time web content, allowing it to answer questions with up-to-date information beyond its knowledge cutoff. Claude automatically cites sources from search results as part of its answer.


  Please reach out through our [feedback form](https://forms.gle/sWjBtsrNEY2oKGuE8) to share your experience with the web search tool.


## Supported models

Web search is available on:

* Claude Opus 4 (`claude-opus-4-20250514`)
* Claude Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
* Claude Sonnet 3.7 (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`)
* Claude Sonnet 3.5 (new) (`claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`)
* Claude Haiku 3.5 (`claude-3-5-haiku-latest`)

## How web search works

When you add the web search tool to your API request:

1. Claude decides when to search based on the prompt.
2. The API executes the searches and provides Claude with the results. This process may repeat multiple times throughout a single request.
3. At the end of its turn, Claude provides a final response with cited sources.

## How to use web search


  Your organization's administrator must enable web search in [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/privacy).


Provide the web search tool in your API request:


  ```bash Shell
  curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
      --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
      --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
      --header "content-type: application/json" \
      --data '{
          "model": "claude-opus-4-20250514",
          "max_tokens": 1024,
          "messages": [
              {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "How do I update a web app to TypeScript 5.5?"
              }
          ],
          "tools": [{
              "type": "web_search_20250305",
              "name": "web_search",
              "max_uses": 5
          }]
      }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  response = client.messages.create(
      model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
      max_tokens=1024,
      messages=[
          {
              "role": "user",
              "content": "How do I update a web app to TypeScript 5.5?"
          }
      ],
      tools=[{
          "type": "web_search_20250305",
          "name": "web_search",
          "max_uses": 5
      }]
  )
  print(response)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript
  import { Anthropic } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

  const anthropic = new Anthropic();

  async function main() {
    const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: "claude-opus-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: 1024,
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: "How do I update a web app to TypeScript 5.5?"
        }
      ],
      tools: [{
        type: "web_search_20250305",
        name: "web_search",
        max_uses: 5
      }]
    });

    console.log(response);
  }

  main().catch(console.error);
  ```


### Tool definition

The web search tool supports the following parameters:

```json JSON
{
  "type": "web_search_20250305",
  "name": "web_search",

  // Optional: Limit the number of searches per request
  "max_uses": 5,

  // Optional: Only include results from these domains
  "allowed_domains": ["example.com", "trusteddomain.org"],

  // Optional: Never include results from these domains
  "blocked_domains": ["untrustedsource.com"],

  // Optional: Localize search results
  "user_location": {
    "type": "approximate",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "region": "California",
    "country": "US",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
}
```

#### Max uses

The `max_uses` parameter limits the number of searches performed. If Claude attempts more searches than allowed, the `web_search_tool_result` will be an error with the `max_uses_exceeded` error code.

#### Domain filtering

When using domain filters:

* Domains should not include the HTTP/HTTPS scheme (use `example.com` instead of `https://example.com`)
* Subdomains are automatically included (`example.com` covers `docs.example.com`)
* Subpaths are supported (`example.com/blog`)
* You can use either `allowed_domains` or `blocked_domains`, but not both in the same request.

#### Localization

The `user_location` parameter allows you to localize search results based on a user's location.

* `type`: The type of location (must be `approximate`)
* `city`: The city name
* `region`: The region or state
* `country`: The country
* `timezone`: The [IANA timezone ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

### Response

      }
    },
    // 3. Search results
    {
      "type": "web_search_tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "srvtoolu_01WYG3ziw53XMcoyKL4XcZmE",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "web_search_result",
          "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon",

          "encrypted_content": "EqgfCioIARgBIiQ3YTAwMjY1Mi1mZjM5LTQ1NGUtODgxNC1kNjNjNTk1ZWI3Y...",
          "page_age": "April 30, 2025"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "text": "Based on the search results, ",
      "type": "text"
    },
    // 4. Claude's response with citations
    {
      "text": "Claude Shannon was born on April 30, 1916, in Petoskey, Michigan",
      "type": "text",
      "citations": [
        {

        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "id": "msg_a930390d3a",
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 6039,
    "output_tokens": 931,
    "server_tool_use": {
      "web_search_requests": 1
    }
  },
  "stop_reason": "end_turn"
}
```

#### Search results

Search results include:

* `url`: The URL of the source page
* `title`: The title of the source page
* `page_age`: When the site was last updated
* `encrypted_content`: Encrypted content that must be passed back in multi-turn conversations for citations

#### Citations

Citations are always enabled for web search, and each `web_search_result_location` includes:

* `url`: The URL of the cited source
* `title`: The title of the cited source
* `encrypted_index`: A reference that must be passed back for multi-turn conversations.
* `cited_text`: Up to 150 characters of the cited content

The web search citation fields `cited_text`, `title`, and `url` do not count towards input or output token usage.


  When displaying web results or information contained in web results to end users, inline citations must be made clearly visible and clickable in your user interface.


#### Errors

If an error occurs during web search, you'll receive a response that takes the following form:

```json
{
  "type": "web_search_tool_result",
  "tool_use_id": "servertoolu_a93jad",
  "content": {
    "type": "web_search_tool_result_error",
    "error_code": "max_uses_exceeded"
  }
}
```

These are the possible error codes:

* `too_many_requests`: Rate limit exceeded
* `invalid_input`: Invalid search query parameter
* `max_uses_exceeded`: Maximum web search tool uses exceeded
* `query_too_long`: Query exceeds maximum length
* `unavailable`: An internal error occurred

#### `pause_turn` stop reason

The response may include a `pause_turn` stop reason, which indicates that the API paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let Claude continue its turn, or modify the content if you wish to interrupt the conversation.

## Prompt caching

Web search works with [prompt caching](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching). To enable prompt caching, add at least one `cache_control` breakpoint in your request. The system will automatically cache up until the last `web_search_tool_result` block when executing the tool.

For multi-turn conversations, set a `cache_control` breakpoint on or after the last `web_search_tool_result` block to reuse cached content.

For example, to use prompt caching with web search for a multi-turn conversation:


  ```python
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  # First request with web search and cache breakpoint
  messages = [
      {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What's the current weather in San Francisco today?"
      }
  ]

  response1 = client.messages.create(
      model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
      max_tokens=1024,
      messages=messages,
      tools=[{
          "type": "web_search_20250305",
          "name": "web_search",
          "user_location": {
              "type": "approximate",
              "city": "San Francisco",
              "region": "California",
              "country": "US",
              "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
          }
      }]
  )

  # Add Claude's response to the conversation
  messages.append({
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": response1.content
  })

  # Second request with cache breakpoint after the search results
  messages.append({
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Should I expect rain later this week?",
      "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}  # Cache up to this point
  })

  response2 = client.messages.create(
      model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
      max_tokens=1024,
      messages=messages,
      tools=[{
          "type": "web_search_20250305",
          "name": "web_search",
          "user_location": {
              "type": "approximate",
              "city": "San Francisco",
              "region": "California",
              "country": "US",
              "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
          }
      }]
  )
  # The second response will benefit from cached search results
  # while still being able to perform new searches if needed
  print(f"Cache read tokens: {response2.usage.get('cache_read_input_tokens', 0)}")
  ```


## Streaming

With streaming enabled, you'll receive search events as part of the stream. There will be a pause while the search executes:

```javascript
event: message_start
data: {"type": "message_start", "message": {"id": "msg_abc123", "type": "message"}}

event: content_block_start
data: {"type": "content_block_start", "index": 0, "content_block": {"type": "text", "text": ""}}

// Claude's decision to search

event: content_block_start
data: {"type": "content_block_start", "index": 1, "content_block": {"type": "server_tool_use", "id": "srvtoolu_xyz789", "name": "web_search"}}

// Search query streamed
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 1, "delta": {"type": "input_json_delta", "partial_json": "{\"query\":\"latest quantum computing breakthroughs 2025\"}"}}

// Pause while search executes

// Search results streamed
event: content_block_start
data: {"type": "content_block_start", "index": 2, "content_block": {"type": "web_search_tool_result", "tool_use_id": "srvtoolu_xyz789", "content": [{"type": "web_search_result", "title": "Quantum Computing Breakthroughs in 2025", "url": "https://example.com"}]}}

// Claude's response with citations (omitted in this example)
```

## Batch requests

You can include the web search tool in the [Messages Batches API](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing). Web search tool calls through the Messages Batches API are priced the same as those in regular Messages API requests.

## Usage and pricing

Web search usage is charged in addition to token usage:

```json
"usage": {
  "input_tokens": 105,
  "output_tokens": 6039,
  "cache_read_input_tokens": 7123,
  "cache_creation_input_tokens": 7345,
  "server_tool_use": {
    "web_search_requests": 1
  }
}
```

Web search is available on the Anthropic API for \$10 per 1,000 searches, plus standard token costs for search-generated content. Web search results retrieved throughout a conversation are counted as input tokens, in search iterations executed during a single turn and in subsequent conversation turns.

Each web search counts as one use, regardless of the number of results returned. If an error occurs during web search, the web search will not be billed.

## ASSISTANT:

I notice that there are no debug messages from `greger-parser--add-citations-to-content-blocks`, which means the function isn't being called at all! This suggests that the merge function isn't finding the correct content structure.

The problem is clear now - I can see that the parsing creates separate assistant messages instead of merging them into a single assistant message with multiple content blocks. Looking at the section results in the debug output:

1. `Section result: ((role . assistant) (content ((type . server_tool_use) ...` - creates assistant message #1
2. `Section result: ((role . assistant) (content ((type . server_tool_result) ...` - creates assistant message #2  
3. `Section result: ((role . assistant) (content . "Based on the search results, <cite>...` - creates assistant message #3

So by the time the citations data is processed, there are **3 separate assistant messages**, not one assistant message with 3 content blocks.

The consecutive message merging happens later via `greger-parser--merge-consecutive-messages`, which combines them into one assistant message with multiple content blocks. But the citations merging happens **before** that step.

Let me fix this by making the citations merging happen after the consecutive message merging. I need to modify the flow to handle citations at the document level rather than at the individual section level.

Here's what I need to do:

1. Store the citations data temporarily instead of trying to merge immediately
2. After all sections are parsed and consecutive messages are merged, then apply the citations
3. Process the citations at the document level

Let me modify the approach:

## ASSISTANT:

Excellent! It's working now. I can see from the debug output:

1. The citations data is being stored for later processing: `"Found citations data, storing for later processing"`
2. Citations are being applied after message merging: `"Applying citations to 2 messages"`
3. The `<cite>` tags are being found and processed: `"Found cite tags, processing..."`
4. The citations are being added to the content block: `"Added citations to block"`

However, there are some issues:

1. The generated markdown is missing the citations section
2. The citations aren't being properly folded into the previous assistant section

Let me now remove the debug output and implement the markdown generation for citations:

Now I need to add support for generating the citations section in the markdown output. Looking at the example format I want:

```markdown
## CITATIONS:

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon

Title: Claude Shannon - Wikipedia

Encrypted index: Eo8BCioIAhgBIiQyYjQ0OWJmZi1lNm..
```

I need to modify the markdown generation to:
1. Check if any content blocks have citations
2. If so, generate the CITATIONS section after the assistant content

Let me add support for this in the block-to-markdown function:

Perfect! The infrastructure is already there. Now I need to check if the `greger-parser--block-to-markdown-with-citations` function exists:

There's still some debug code there and the logic doesn't look right. Let me see the full function and then fix it:

## ASSISTANT:

Now let me check how the assistant-to-markdown function currently works to understand the issue:

  "Convert system CONTENT to markdown."
  (concat greger-parser-system-tag "\n\n" content))
</tool.toolu_01VgRqr73mSBkWxwnGSn9JcT>

## ASSISTANT:

Good! The assistant-to-markdown function is already using `greger-parser--content-blocks-to-markdown-with-citations`. Now I need to:

1. Remove the debug message
2. Fix the logic so that text blocks don't add their own ASSISTANT header (since it's added at the message level)
3. Make sure cite tags are preserved correctly

Let me fix the function:
